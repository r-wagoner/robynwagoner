        <p>From a young age, Robyn has demonstrated "rebellious tendencies". Perhaps this originates
          with her name - a reference to the Olde English, Robin Goodfellow, Hobgoblin, or Puck -
          a mischievous faery trickster.
        </p>

        <p>Or perhaps the reason lies in her astrological sign, Libra, which is known for acting as
          the Devil's advocate, heckling those in authority, and serving as the class clown and general upstart.
        </p>

        <p>A fan, artist, and muse of underground, experimental art, she was immediately drawn to protest music,
          punk rock, and hip-hop for their challenging of societal norms. At 18-years-old, Robyn was
          the first female roadie for Van Halen, pioneering women's technical positions in the music industry.
          She also toured as a professional drummer for a decade, upending more stereotypes about the role of women
          in rock. She's been arrested for protesting
        </p>

        <p>  A close friend once coined the moniker "The Instigator" to describe Robyn's character arc and motivation.
          People tend to love her or hate her. This information may discourage you from reaching out in
          friendship, especially if you're shy. Yet don't discount Robyn too quickly, for although she is known
          as a wily opponent, you rarely find a more loyal ally.
        </p>

        <p>Robyn's path is a strange and difficult one, producing volumes of material for her stand-up comedy
          routines where she happily mocks notions of power normalcy.
