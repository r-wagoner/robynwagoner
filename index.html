        <p>From a young age, Robyn has demonstrated "rebellious tendencies". Perhaps this originates
          with her name - a reference to the Olde English, Robin Goodfellow, Hobgoblin, or Puck -
          a mischievous faery trickster.
        </p>

        <p>Or perhaps the reason lies in her astrological sign, Libra, which is known for acting as
          the Devil's advocate, going against the grain, heckling those in authority, and
          serving as the class clown and general upstart. A close friend once coined the moniker
          "The Instigator" to describe Robyn's foundational character arc and motivation.
        </p>

        <p>A fan, artist, and muse of underground, experimental art, she was immediately drawn to protest music,
          punk rock, and hip-hop for their challenging of societal norms. At 18-years-old, Robyn was
          the first female roadie for Van Halen, pioneering women's roles in stagehand work. She toured
          as a professional drummer for a decade in the early 2000's, upending stereotypes about the roles
          of women in rock music.
        </p>

        <p>Still, Robyn's life has been less than glamorous. She faced a tremendous amount of sexism in the music
          industry in the early nineteen eighties. As a young single mother, she struggled with houselessness. She
          was arrested and assaulted by police for protesting their excessive force, and was fired from a job for
          defending abused women farmers. She is still routinely targeted by bullies for her outsider behavior.
        </p>

        <p> People tend to love her or hate her and this information may discourage you from reaching out in
          friendship, especially if you're shy. Yet don't discount Robyn too quickly. For although she is known
          as a wily opponent, you won't find a more loyal ally.
        </p>

        <p>Robyn's path is a strange and difficult one, producing volumes of material for her stand-up comedy
          routines where she happily speaks truth to power and mocks notions of normalcy.
