        <p>Robyn likes to problem solve. She earned the nickname "The Instigator" for starting large scale projects
          to solve complex social problems.</p>

        <p>As a guitarist for the Albuquerque band "No Punx", im 1987, Robyn became frustrated that there were no venues
          booking original music because local promoter, Joe Buffaliino, had a monopoly on booking the clubs and
          installed his cover bands in every open slot. To address this injustice, she founded the non-profit "New
          Mexico Music Industry Coalition" (NM MIC) and served as the Chair. The organization rallied local original
          artists, engineers, and music professionals in support of original acts in a variety of ways, including
          developing the annual "New Mexico Music Awards". This prestigious event is now in its 35th year.
        </p>

        <p>As a vegetarian, a mother, a student, and and a natural food advocate living in poverty, Robyn was horrified
          that her beloved, La Montañita Food Co-op, moved into an expensive Nob Hill Shopping Center and hired three
          CEOs from Los Angeles, agreeing to pay them a million dollars each and passing the cost down to the members.
          In 1995, she organized the "Dirt City Food Co-op" and using the same distribution networks as La Montañita,
          the group made weekly purchases at wholesale prices.
        </p>

        <p>As a former disc jockey for KQEO and KZZX, Robyn was frustrated by the rigid playlists and lack of
          honest journalism in Albuquerque radio. So, in 1997, she founded the pirate station, "Rebel Radio" with a
          40-watt transmitter donated by Free-Radio Berkeley. For three years, the low-power FM community radio station
          broadcast in the UNM student ghetto every Tuesday night until under threat of heavy fines from the FCC, they
          shut the door and started making zines instead. Captain America's popular "Wig Wam Bam" zine was a product.
        </p>

        <p>As an animal advocate, Robyn was upset by the abuse and neglect of horses that she witnessed on farms in her
          area outside of Silver City, New Mexico. She traded organic orchard management duties for access to a 15-acre
          plot of red winter wheat and, in 1999, she established "Willow River Equine Rescue." Over a three-year period,
          she acquired, rehabilitated, and re-homed eight magnificent animals of all breeds, ages, and conditions.
        </p>

        <p>As a full-time touring musician with her indie bands "Fast Heart Mart" and "Hobos In Limbo", Robyn was forced
          to learn the business of video and audio production, web design, music management, booking, publicity, and
          marketing. In 2003, she formed "Crawford's Attractions, LLC", a multimedia and event production agency. She
          then offered her services to other pet projects including artists, authors, cooperatives, and non-profits. She
          is currently working on an animated feature sci-fi adventure rom-com written by her daughter, Justis Biggart,
          called, "I Fell in Love with a Body Snatcher."
        </p>

        <p>On the horizon, for Robyn, are two projects she is passionate about. One, is starting an outdoor comedy venue
          because COVID19 makes indoor events so dangerous. Pre-pandemic, she started doing stand-up and now has no
          safe outlet for this craft.
          </p>
        <!---I don't know how long this is supposed to be so if it needs to be one paragraph, please use the following:--->
        <p>A new project Robyn wants to develop depends on her success in learning to code. It will address the threat
          to voting rights. The project involves developing an open source and transparent voting platform in which
          tampering can be easily identified. People can vote from any computer or smart phone and results would be
          immediately available. This would allow citizens to vote on issues instead of cult of personality. There could
          be ranked-choice voting and we could do away with political parties. Anyone who wanted to run for a position
          could do so and voter information could be linked in the platform as well as fora for discussion of issues.
