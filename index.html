        <p>Robyn likes to start things. She earned the nickname "The Instigator" for initiating large-scale projects
          to solve complex social problems. She plans to take the world by storm, one individual at a time!!!
        </p>

        <p>As a "Bad-A$$", take no lip, guitarist for the Albuquerque band "No Punx", im 1987, Robyn became frustrated that there were no venues
          booking original music. To address this injustice, she organized the non-profit "New Mexico Music Industry
          Coalition" (NM MIC) and developed the annual "New Mexico Music Awards" - now in its 35th year!
        </p>

        <p>Robyn was horrified that her beloved, La Montañita Food Co-op, moved into an expensive Nob Hill Shopping
          Center passing the cost down to the members. In 1995, she organized the "Dirt City Food Co-op" and using the
          same distribution networks as La Montañita, the group made weekly purchases at wholesale prices.
        </p>

        <p>Robyn was frustrated by the rigid playlists and lack of honest journalism in Albuquerque radio. So, in 1997,
          she founded the pirate station, "Rebel Radio" with a 40-watt transmitter donated by Free-Radio Berkeley.
          They broadcast in the UNM student ghetto every Tuesday night until, under threat of heavy fines from the FCC,
          they cut the power and pivoted to making zines.
        </p>

        <p>As an animal advocate, Robyn was upset by the abuse and neglect of horses that she witnessed on farms in her
          area outside of Silver City, New Mexico. In 1999, she established "Willow River Equine Rescue." Over a three-
          year period, she acquired, rehabilitated, and re-homed eight magnificent animals.
        </p>

        <p>As a full-time touring musician Robyn was forced to learn the business of video and audio production, web
          design, music management, booking, and marketing. In 2003, she formed "Crawford's Attractions, LLC", a multi-
          media and event production agency. She then offered her services to other pet projects including artists,
          authors, cooperatives, and non-profits. The company is currently working on an animated feature sci-fi
          rom-com called, "I Fell in Love with a Body Snatcher" that was written by Robyn's daughter, Justis Biggart,

        <!---I don't know how long this is supposed to be so if it needs to be one paragraph, please use the following:--->
        <p>A new project Robyn wants to develop depends on her success in learning to code. It will address the threat
          to voting rights and involves developing an open source voting platform in which tampering can be easily
          identified. People can vote from any smart phone and results would be immediately available. This would allow
          voting on issues instead of personalities. It would support ranked-choice voting and do-away with political
          parties. Anyone who wanted to run for a position could do so and voter information could be linked in the
          platform as well as forum for discussion of issues.
